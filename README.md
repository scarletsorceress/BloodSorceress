hi, im blood sorceress.
i like programming and now i'm learning python, c# and js
i'm new as a programmer but i'll try to improve myself and my programming skills.

i have a discord. @Blood Sorceress#8946






i'm not a girl, this nickname came by an old(not that old) game called AQW(Adventure Quest Worlds)
where one of the classes is called Blood Sorceress and i like it, so i took that as my nickname.



eu gosto de torta.
